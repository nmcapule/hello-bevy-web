# hello-bevy-web

## Development

To compile and run the app, run the following command:

```sh
$ ./compile_and_serve.sh
```

## Conclusion

Development of rust bevy for the web is suuuuper slow :( Takes me 1 minute to
compile and run the example app in Codespaces.

```sh
$ ./compile_and_serve.sh
    Blocking waiting for file lock on package cache
    Blocking waiting for file lock on build directory

Not fun. For now :P
